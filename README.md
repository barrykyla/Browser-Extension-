# BrowserExtension
 I wanted this project to be a meaningful one and decided to target insecurities in our perspectives of ourselves, and despite what Vogue might deem as beautiful is not always the case. So, in my browser extensions I inserted a link titled "YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL". This link redirects you to a website tiled "This is Beauty", and this initiative was started by the organization called The Body Positivity. They work towards showing all shapes, sizes, ethnicities, and genders are beautiful, and that there is not a standard for beauty.

I really wanted to hone in on this idea of loving yourself and accepting you as something that can be amazing. I chose to demonstrate my extension on Vogue because they have one specific part of their fashion blog titled "models", and these articles only contain images of what you would picture as an average model. Within this website I decided to challenge the idea of style by including that link to "This is Beauty" and wanted to show that there are healthy ways to live your life. That is why I included the images of food instead of the models to show that you can be healthy without being as skinny as some of the models are in those images.

Overall, I really wanted that message of loving yourself even if society tells you are not pretty that you stand up and realize that society is wrong.
